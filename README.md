# BattleCode
BattleCode is an educational and recreational application designed for students and programmers
who want to test and improve their knowledge in technical fields such as
programming, algorithms, databases and software development. The game is played in
singleplayer sessions with timed questions, scored according to difficulty. 
The BattleCode system allows users to authenticate, participate in trivia battles and
accumulate points. The questions are extracted from a database by difficulty level, and
each answer has a limited time. Users can track rankings.
